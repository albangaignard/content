                "abstract": "\u00a9 2019 The AuthorsFresh fish are highly perishable food products and their short shelf-life limits their commercial exploitation and leads to waste, which has a negative impact on aquaculture sustainability. New non-thermal food processing methods, such as high pressure (HP) processing, prolong shelf-life while assuring high food quality. The effect of HP processing (600MPa, 25 \u00b0C, 5min) on European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) fillet quality and shelf life was investigated. The data presented comprises microbiome and proteome profiles of control and HP-processed sea bass fillets from 1 to 67 days of isothermal storage at 2 \u00b0C. Bacterial diversity was analysed by Illumina high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene in pooled DNAs from control or HP-processed fillets after 1, 11 or 67 days and the raw reads were deposited in the NCBI-SRA database with accession number PRJNA517618. Yeast and fungi diversity were analysed by high-throughput sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region for control and HP-processed fillets at the end of storage (11 or 67 days, respectively) and have the SRA accession number PRJNA517779. Quantitative label-free proteomics profiles were analysed by SWATH-MS (Sequential Windowed data independent Acquisition of the Total High-resolution-Mass Spectra) in myofibrillar or sarcoplasmic enriched protein extracts pooled for control or HP-processed fillets after 1, 11 and 67 days of storage. Proteome data was deposited in the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifiers PXD012737. These data support the findings reported in the associated manuscript \u201cHigh pressure processing of European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) fillets and tools for flesh quality and shelf life monitoring\u201d, Tsironi et al., 2019, JFE 262:83\u201391, doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2019.05.010.",
