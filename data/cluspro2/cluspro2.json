                "abstract": "\u00a9 2019 The Author (s).Purpose: Interferon beta (IFN-\u03b2) is used to combat multiple sclerosis (MS) disease. Creating R27T and V101F mutations (mHuIFN-\u03b2-27 and mHuIFN-\u03b2-101) is one of the tasks performed to improve human interferon beta (HuIFN-\u03b2) half-life, function and expression. In this work, the impact of R27T and V101F mutations in recombinant IFN-\u03b2 on its binding to interferon receptors were studied by molecular docking. Methods: This work was performed through in silico study. The simulation of mutation was performed using the online Rosetta Backrub software and checked using server verify3D. Comparison of access to the solvent of the amino acids in the structures created was performed using the asaview online server. Also, the effect of mutations on the fold of the protein was reviewed by the online HOPE server. The molecular docking was performed between HuIFN-\u03b2 and the external region of IFNAR receptor using the online ClusPro2 protein-protein docking server. Results: The comparison of the values of the negative binding energy (\u0394Gbind) obtained from protein-protein molecular docking between IFNAR receptor and HuIFN-\u03b2, mHuIFN-\u03b2-27, mHuIFN-\u03b2-101 and mHuIFN-\u03b2-27-101 ligands did not show a significant difference, and these differences do not see any meaningful relationship between them (P > 0.9999). Conclusion: Regarding these results, it can be concluded that these mutations do not have a negative effect on the composition of the complex rHuIFN-\u03b2/IFNAR. So, they do not interfere with the binding of the IFN-\u03b2 to the receptor. It is concluded that the quality of the rHuIFN-\u03b2 is improved by introducing these two mutations.",
