All rights reserved.Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a tumor that derives from the rectum or colon, and colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) is the most common type of CRC. The present study was performed to identify genes that serve critical roles in the survival of patients with COAD. RNA-sequencing data of COAD was extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas database, which included 480 tumor samples and 41 normal samples. Using the limma package, differential expression analysis was performed to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). In addition, the potential functions and pathways for the identified DEGs were analyzed using the clusterProfiler package. After the samples were divided into high and low expression groups, survival analysis for the two groups was performed using the Kaplan-Meier model. Using Cytoscape software, a protein-protein interaction network was generated for the survival-associated genes. A total of 1,519 DEGs, including 568 upregulated genes and 951 downregulated genes, were identified in the COAD samples. Enrichment analysis suggested that the DEGs were implicated in numerous functional terms and pathways. Furthermore, 109 DEGs were identified to be survival-associated genes in COAD. According to the degrees of the network nodes, 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1D (HTR1D), TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 1 (TIMP1), serpin family E member 1 (SERPINE1), matrix metallopeptidase 3 (MMP3) and cannabinoid receptor 2 (CNR2) were key nodes, and the expression levels of these genes were analyzed in clinical samples of CRC. Therefore, the results of the present study suggest HTR1D, TIMP1, SERPINE1, MMP3 and CNR2 may affect the prognosis of patients with COAD.",
