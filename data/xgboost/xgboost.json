    "description": "Putative biomarkers for predicting tumor sample purity based on gene expression data.\n\nExtreme Gradient Boosting, which is an efficient implementation of the gradient boosting framework from Chen & Guestrin (2016) <doi:10.1145/2939672.2939785>. This package is its R interface. The package includes efficient linear model solver and tree learning algorithms. The package can automatically do parallel computation on a single machine which could be more than 10 times faster than existing gradient boosting packages. It supports various objective functions, including regression, classification and ranking. The package is made to be extensible, so that users are also allowed to define their own objectives easily.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'tumor purity', 'tumor', 'ten-gene', 'purity'",

                "abstract": "\u00a9 2019 The Author(s).Background: Tumor purity is the percent of cancer cells present in a sample of tumor tissue. The non-cancerous cells (immune cells, fibroblasts, etc.) have an important role in tumor biology. The ability to determine tumor purity is important to understand the roles of cancerous and non-cancerous cells in a tumor. Methods: We applied a supervised machine learning method, XGBoost, to data from 33 TCGA tumor types to predict tumor purity using RNA-seq gene expression data. Results: Across the 33 tumor types, the median correlation between observed and predicted tumor-purity ranged from 0.75 to 0.87 with small root mean square errors, suggesting that tumor purity can be accurately predicted \u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd\u03b3expression data. We further confirmed that expression levels of a ten-gene set (CSF2RB, RHOH, C1S, CCDC69, CCL22, CYTIP, POU2AF1, FGR, CCL21, and IL7R) were predictive of tumor purity regardless of tumor type. We tested whether our set of ten genes could accurately predict tumor purity of a TCGA-independent data set. We showed that expression levels from our set of ten genes were highly correlated (\u03c1 = 0.88) with the actual observed tumor purity. Conclusions: Our analyses suggested that the ten-gene set may serve as a biomarker for tumor purity prediction using gene expression data.",
