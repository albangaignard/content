    "description": "Healthcare queries over distributed resources.\n\nRbbt stands for \u201cRuby Bioinformatics Toolkit\u201d. It is a framework for software development in bioinformatics. It covers three aspects:.\n\nWorkflow wrapping the TF text-mining results from https://github.com/fnl plus other databases.\n\nHigh Throughput Sequencing related functionalities.\n\nRbbt wrapper for the Variant Effect Predictor. Auto-downloads and installs the software.\n\nTo try out workflows the easiest way is to use them remotely. If you manage to install Ruby and the gems rbbt-util and rbbt-rest you can try the following examples; they should give you a taste of how it works.\n\n||| COMMON LINK WITH (PUB. & NAME DIFFERENT) bio.tools/pymzml (GITHUB.COM).\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Patient Dossier', 'mikisvaz'",

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.As with many other aspects of the modern world, in healthcare, the explosion of data and resources opens new opportunities for the development of added-value services. Still, a number of specific conditions on this domain greatly hinders these developments, including ethical and legal issues, fragmentation of the relevant data in different locations, and a level of (meta) data complexity that requires great expertise across technical, clinical, and biological domains. We propose the Patient Dossier paradigm as a way to organize new innovative healthcare services that sorts the current limitations. The Patient Dossier conceptual framework identifies the different issues and suggests how they can be tackled in a safe, efficient, and responsible way while opening options for independent development for different players in the healthcare sector. An initial implementation of the Patient Dossier concepts in the Rbbt framework is available as open-source at https://github.com/mikisvaz and https://github.com/Rbbt-Workflows.",
