This program was written using Python programming language and the calculation of buildup factors was based on the well-known Geometric Progression (GP) fitting procedure. The equivalent atomic numbers and GP fitting parameters of mixtures and compounds can also be evaluated using this program",

This program was written using Python programming language and the calculation of buildup factors was based on the well-known Geometric Progression (GP) fitting procedure. The equivalent atomic numbers and GP fitting parameters of mixtures and compounds can also be evaluated using this program. The program has been used to evaluate the photon exposure and energy absorption buildup factors for standard energy grid from 0.015- 15 MeV for water, air and concrete, compared with values from the American Nuclear Society (ANS) standard reference data (ANSI-6.4.3) and found to be of high accurate with minimal errors. The program is fast and easy to use and will be of valuable interest to medical Physicist, radiation Physicists, Radiation shielding design engineers, students, teachers and researchers and other experts working in areas where nuclear radiation is applied.",
