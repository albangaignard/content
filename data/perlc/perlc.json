    "description": "Enhancing Access to Quality Online Training to Strengthen Public Health Preparedness and Response.\n\nPERLC Training Database and Guide.\n\nThe PERLC Training Catalog features online training and other learning materials to help public health professionals and their partners prepare for and respond to emergencies. These materials were developed by university-based Preparedness and Emergency Response Learning Centers (PERLCs) funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from 2010 to 2015. They mostly consist of online courses, as well as some exercises, toolkits and guides. The majority of available online PERLC materials are introductory-level, therefore, most of the content in this catalog is best suited for users who are looking to build awareness or begin their education in these topics.\n\nTo learn more about the development of this catalog, visit the About page.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'preparedness', 'emergency preparedness'",

All rights reserved.Objectives: To improve access to quality online training materials developed from 2010 to 2015 by 14 Preparedness and Emergency Response Learning Centers (PERLCs) by creating quality standards and enhancing searchability through a new Web-based public health training catalog. Methods: The PERLC-developed training materials (n = 530) were evaluated for their capability to support development of preparedness competencies as established by 2 evidence-based competency frameworks. Inclusion/exclusion criteria and evaluation guidelines regarding training quality (design, technology, and instructional components) were systematically applied to PERLC products to create a training catalog. Twenty emergency preparedness professionals pilot tested content and provided feedback to improve catalog design and function. Results: Seventy-eight percent of PERLC resources (n = 413) met our quality standards for inclusion in the catalog's searchable database: 358 self-paced courses, 55 informational briefs, and other materials. Twenty-one training bundles were curated. Discussion: We established quality guidelines, identified strengths and weaknesses in PERLC resources, and improved accessibility to trainings. Guidelines established by this work can be generalized to trainings outside the preparedness domain. Enhancing access to quality training resources can serve as a valuable tool for increasing emergency preparedness competence.",
