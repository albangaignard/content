    "description": "Simultaneous detection and quantification of DNA and protein biomarkers in spectrum of cardiovascular diseases in a microfluidic microbead chip.\n\nAnalysis, visualisation and data mining of POCT experiments.\n\ndigilogger is available as the latest development version of the code by using the devtools R package.\n\nOur digilogger standalone graphical user interface allows the analysis of dPCR data without installing the package on a server. Since the digilogger software is based on modern web technologies like HTML5 it will run on any modern web browser. Additionally, the software works when run in RStudio or RKWard (version 0.7.0z+0.7.1+devel1). The digilogger software works platform independent (tested on Linux and Windows).\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'cfmDNA', 'microbeads', 'microfluidic', 'biomarkers'",

                "abstract": "\u00a9 2019, The Author(s).The rapid and simultaneous detection of DNA and protein biomarkers is necessary to detect the outbreak of a disease or to monitor a disease. For example, cardiovascular diseases are a major cause of adult mortality worldwide. We have developed a rapidly adaptable platform to assess biomarkers using a microfluidic technology. Our model mimics autoantibodies against three proteins, C-reactive protein (CRP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Cell-free mitochondrial DNA (cfmDNA) and DNA controls are detected via fluorescence probes. The biomarkers are covalently bound on the surface of size- (11\u201315 \u03bcm) and dual-color encoded microbeads and immobilized as planar layer in a microfluidic chip flow cell. Binding events of target molecules were analyzed by fluorescence measurements with a fully automatized fluorescence microscope (end-point and real-time) developed in house. The model system was optimized for buffers and immobilization strategies of the microbeads to enable the simultaneous detection of protein and DNA biomarkers. All prime target molecules (anti-CRP, anti-BNP, anti-LDL, cfmDNA) and the controls were successfully detected both in independent reactions and simultaneously. In addition, the biomarkers could also be detected in spiked human serum in a similar way as in the optimized buffer system. The detection limit specified by the manufacturer is reduced by at least a factor of five for each biomarker as a result of the antibody detection and kinetic experiments indicate that nearly 50 % of the fluorescence intensity is achieved within 7 min. For rapid data inspection, we have developed the open source software digilogger, which can be applied for data evaluation and visualization. [Figure not available: see fulltext.].",
