    "description": "> HOMEPAGE BROKEN! | adapting NERBio to chemical patents via full-token features and named entity feature with chemical sub-class composition | Chemical patents contain detailed information on novel chemical compounds that is valuable to the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. In this paper, we introduce a system, NERChem that can recognize chemical named entity mentions in chemical patents. NERChem is based on the conditional random fields model (CRF). Our approach incorporates ( 1 ) class composition, which is used for combining chemical classes whose naming conventions are similar; ( 2 ) BioNE features, which are used for distinguishing chemical mentions from other biomedical NE mentions in the patents; and ( 3 ) full-token word features, which are used to resolve the tokenization granularity problem",

We evaluated our approach on the BioCreative V CHEMDNER-patent corpus, and achieved an F-score of 87.17% in the Chemical Entity Mention in Patents (CEMP) task and a sensitivity of 98.58% in the Chemical Passage Detection (CPD) task, ranking alongside the top systems.",
