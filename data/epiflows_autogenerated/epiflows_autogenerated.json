    "description": "an R package for risk assessment of travel-related spread of disease | \u2623\u2708\ufe0f Risk assessment of travel-related disease spread | Predicting Disease Spread from Flow Data | Welcome to the epiflows package! | epiflows is a package for predicting and visualising spread of infectious diseases based on flows between geographical locations, e.g., countries. epiflows provides functions for calculating spread estimates, handling flow data, and visualization | Provides functions and classes designed to handle and visualise epidemiological flows between locations. Also contains a statistical method for predicting disease spread from flow data initially described in Dorigatti et al. (2017) <doi:10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2017.22.28.30572>. This package is part of the RECON (<http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/>) toolkit for outbreak analysis",

In this paper we present epiflows, an R package for risk assessment of travel-related spread of disease. epiflows produces estimates of the expected number of symptomatic and/or asymptomatic infections that could be introduced to other locations from the source of infection. Estimates (average and confidence intervals) of the number of infections introduced elsewhere are obtained by integrating data on the cumulative number of cases reported, population movement, length of stay and information on the distributions of the incubation and infectious periods of the disease. The package also provides tools for geocoding and visualization. We illustrate the use of epiflows by assessing the risk of travel-related spread of yellow fever cases in Southeast Brazil in December 2016 to May 2017.",
