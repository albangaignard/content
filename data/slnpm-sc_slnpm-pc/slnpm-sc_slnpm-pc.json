Identification of lncRNA-miRNA interactions helps to understand the functions of lncRNAs, especially their roles in complicated diseases. Computational methods can save time and reduce cost in identifying lncRNA-miRNA interactions, but there have been only a few computational methods. Results: In this paper, we propose a sequence-derived linear neighborhood propagation method (SLNPM) to predict lncRNA-miRNA interactions. First, we calculate the integrated lncRNA-lncRNA similarity and the integrated miRNA-miRNA similarity by combining known lncRNA-miRNA interactions, lncRNA sequences and miRNA sequences. We consider two similarity calculation strategies respectively, namely similarity-based information combination (SC) and interaction profile-based information combination (PC). Second, the integrated lncRNA similarity-based graph and the integrated miRNA similarity-based graph are respectively constructed, and the label propagation processes are implemented on two graphs to score lncRNA-miRNA pairs. Finally, the weighted averages of their outputs are adopted as final predictions. Therefore, we construct two editions of SLNPM: Sequence-derived linear neighborhood propagation method based on similarity information combination (SLNPM-SC) and sequence-derived linear neighborhood propagation method based on interaction profile information combination (SLNPM-PC). The experimental results show that SLNPM-SC and SLNPM-PC predict lncRNA-miRNA interactions with higher accuracy compared with other state-of-the-art methods. The case studies demonstrate that SLNPM-SC and SLNPM-PC help to find novel lncRNA-miRNA interactions for given lncRNAs or miRNAs. Conclusion: The study reveals that known interactions bring the most important information for lncRNA-miRNA interaction prediction, and sequences of lncRNAs (miRNAs) also provide useful information. In conclusion, SLNPM-SC and SLNPM-PC are promising for lncRNA-miRNA interaction prediction.",
