Identification of causative pathogens accurately and rapidly plays a key role in the success of treatment. To support infectious disease research and mechanisms of infection, there is a need for an open resource on pathogen-disease associations that can be utilized in computational studies. A large number of pathogen-disease associations is available from the literature in unstructured form and we need automated methods to extract the data. Results: We developed a text mining system designed for extracting pathogen-disease relations from literature. Our approach utilizes background knowledge from an ontology and statistical methods for extracting associations between pathogens and diseases. In total, we extracted a total of 3420 pathogen-disease associations from literature. We integrated our literature-derived associations into a database which links pathogens to their phenotypes for supporting infectious disease research. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, we present the first study focusing on extracting pathogen-disease associations from publications. We believe the text mined data can be utilized as a valuable resource for infectious disease research. All the data is publicly available from https://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/padimi and through a public SPARQL endpoint from http://patho.phenomebrowser.net/.",
