    "description": "SANS is a freely available command line tool for phylogenetic \nreconstruction. It is alignment- and reference-free, and accepts \n(multiple) FASTA or FASTQ files containing complete genomes, assembled \ncontigs, or raw reads as input. Sequence segments (in terms of k-mers) \nthat are shared by a set of genomes are used as indicators for \nphylogenetic splits. Splits are combined, weighted, filtered and output \nin tab separated format. They can visualized as a phylogenetic tree or \nnetwork using existing tools such as SplitsTree. SANS is implemented in \nC++, and converter scripts for newick and nexus are provided.",

                "abstract": "\u00a9 2020 The Author(s).Background: The increasing amount of available genome sequence data enables large-scale comparative studies. A common task is the inference of phylogenies - a challenging task if close reference sequences are not available, genome sequences are incompletely assembled, or the high number of genomes precludes multiple sequence alignment in reasonable time. Results: We present a new whole-genome based approach to infer phylogenies that is alignment- and reference-free. In contrast to other methods, it does not rely on pairwise comparisons to determine distances to infer edges in a tree. Instead, a colored de Bruijn graph is constructed, and information on common subsequences is extracted to infer phylogenetic splits. Conclusions: The introduced new methodology for large-scale phylogenomics shows high potential. Application to different datasets confirms robustness of the approach. A comparison to other state-of-the-art whole-genome based methods indicates comparable or higher accuracy and efficiency.",
