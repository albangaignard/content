We describe Cytoscape Automation (CA), which marries Cytoscape to highly productive workflow systems, for example, Python/R in Jupyter/RStudio. We expose over 270 Cytoscape core functions and 34 Cytoscape apps as REST-callable functions with standardized JSON interfaces backed by Swagger documentation. Independent projects to create and publish Python/R native CA interface libraries have reached an advanced stage, and a number of automation workflows are already published.",
