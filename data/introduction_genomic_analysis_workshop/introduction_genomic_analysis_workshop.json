                "abstract": "\u00a9 2019 Richmond PA and Wasserman WW.Researchers in the life sciences are increasingly faced with the task of obtaining compute resources and training to analyze large, high-throughput technology generated datasets. As demand for compute resources has grown, high performance computing (HPC) systems have been implemented by research organizations and international consortiums to support academic researchers. However, life science researchers lack effective time-of-need training resources for utilization of these systems. Current training options have drawbacks that inhibit the effective training of researchers without experience in computational analysis. We identified the need for flexible, centrally-organized, easily accessible, interactive, and compute resource specific training for academic HPC use. In our delivery of a modular workshop series, we provided foundational training to a group of researchers in a coordinated manner, allowing them to further pursue additional training and analysis on compute resources available to them. Efficacy measures indicate that the material was effectively delivered to a broad audience in a short time period, including both virtual and on-site students. The practical approach to catalyze academic HPC use is amenable to diverse systems worldwide.",
