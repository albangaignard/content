    "description": "> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | Improved control of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) requires an additional advanced concept for public health | A major consequence of all elements of the 'epidemiological transition' is the rapid emergence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in low- and middle-income countries. In contrast to the outcomes of the 'Alma Ata Conference for Primary Health Care', it has not yet been possible to introduce an equally powerful health policy for the prevention and control of NCDs. Major strategies so far are to advise individuals not to smoke and drink alcohol in excess. Additionally, 'healthy' nutrition and increased physical activity are also advocated. Policy for preventing and working against NCDs is now part of the Sustainable Development Goals, specifically target 3.4. So far, attempts to soften the influence of NCDs on the health of the people in low- and middle-income countries have been unsuccessful",

In contrast to the outcomes of the \u2018Alma Ata Conference for Primary Health Care\u2019, it has not yet been possible to introduce an equally powerful health policy for the prevention and control of NCDs. Major strategies so far are to advise individuals not to smoke and drink alcohol in excess. Additionally, \u2018healthy\u2019 nutrition and increased physical activity are also advocated. Policy for preventing and working against NCDs is now part of the Sustainable Development Goals, specifically target 3.4. So far, attempts to soften the influence of NCDs on the health of the people in low-and middle-income countries have been unsuccessful. It is argued here that additional concepts on how public health could operate against NCDs are needed. Major risk factors for NCDs interfere with and alter complex steps within the human metabolism. This paper explores how human metabolism works by assessing advances in molecular biology and research in genetics, epigenetics and gerontology. Recent developments in these scientific disciplines shed light on the complexity of how human health is maintained and diseases are invoked. Public health bodies should be aware, interested and possibly contribute to the aforementioned areas of interest, as far as NCDs are concerned, and translate major developments in a way, that could be useful in improving population health.",
