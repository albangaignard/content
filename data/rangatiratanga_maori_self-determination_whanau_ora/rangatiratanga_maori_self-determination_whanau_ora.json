Method: Three pathways were identified as creating opportunities for action on M\u0101ori homelessness: Te Tiriti o Waitangi/Treaty of Waitangi is the M\u0101ori self-determination pathway; Wh\u0101nau Ora, a government-sponsored policy supports wh\u0101nau/family as the pathway for M\u0101ori wellbeing and disparities reduction; and Housing First, an international pathway with local application for homelessness that is being implemented in parts of Aotearoa. The potential opportunities of the three pathways shaped interviews with authoritative M\u0101ori about M\u0101ori principles (derived from the three pathways) for addressing M\u0101ori homelessness. Twenty interviews were conducted with M\u0101ori experts using Kaupapa M\u0101ori research processes, eliciting advice about addressing M\u0101ori homelessness. A principles framework called Whare \u014cranga was developed to synthesise these views. Results: Addressing M\u0101ori homelessness must be anchored in rights-based and culturally aligned practice empowered by M\u0101ori worldviews, principles and processes. Te Tiriti o Waitangi, which endorses M\u0101ori tribal self-determination and authority, and Wh\u0101nau Ora as a government obligation to reduce inequities in M\u0101ori homelessness, are the foundations for such action. Colonisation and historical trauma are root causes of M\u0101ori homelessness. Strong rights-based frameworks are needed to enact decolonisation and guide policy. These frameworks exist in Tino Rangatiratanga/M\u0101ori self-determination and Wh\u0101nau Ora. Conclusion: Whare \u014cranga: An Indigenous Housing Interventions Principles Framework was developed in Aotearoa/New Zealand to end M\u0101ori homelessness. Future research is needed on the practical application of this framework in ending M\u0101ori homelessness. Moreover, the use value of the Whare \u014cranga Framework as a workable approach to ending homelessness in other indigenous populations is yet to be considered.",
