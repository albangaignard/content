The Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB) provides highly cu-rated information on the effect of genetic variation on drug response and side effects for a wide range of drugs. PharmGKB's scientific curators triage, review and annotate a large number of papers each year but the task is challenging. We present the PGxMine resource, a text-mined resource of pharmacogenomic associations from all accessible published liter-ature to assist in the curation of PharmGKB. We developed a supervised machine learning pipeline to extract associations between a variant (DNA and protein changes, star alleles and dbSNP identifiers) and a chemical. PGxMine covers 452 chemicals and 2,426 variants and contains 19,930 mentions of pharmacogenomic associations across 7,170 papers. An evalua-tion by PharmGKB curators found that 57 of the top 100 associations not found in Phar-mGKB led to 83 curatable papers and a further 24 associations would likely lead to curatable papers through citations. The results can be viewed at https://pgxmine.pharmgkb.org/ and code can be downloaded at https://github.com/jakelever/pgxmine.",
