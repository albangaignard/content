                "abstract": "Functional traits can be valuable pieces of information for aquaculture research and management. Although fish traits have been the focus of an abundant research, trait datasets for these organisms are difficult to access and often unpractical to achieve meta-analyses without a time-consuming extensive review. Already available large-scale compilations include trait information for many fish species but not as detailed as required for aquaculture purpose. Here, we introduce the TOFF (i.e. Traits OF Fish), a database focusing on fish functional traits that aims at bringing together behavioral, morphological, phenological, and physiological traits always coupled to environmental measurement context into a single open-source access repository. TOFF hosts data from published field and experimental studies. Here, we release data for 228 traits for 174 species extracted from 165 publications and present a collaborative platform. We ultimately aim at providing an inclusive and accessible data resource to facilitate advances in aquaculture development.",
