                "abstract": "\u00a9 2019 Zhang et al.Alu elements are one of the most successful families of transposons in the human genome. A portion of Alu elements is transcribed by RNA Pol III, whereas the remaining ones are part of Pol II transcripts. Because Alu elements are highly repetitive, it has been difficult to identify the Pol III\u2013transcribed elements and quantify their expression levels. In this study, we generated high-resolution, long-genomic-span RAMPAGE data in 155 biosamples all with matching RNA-seq data and built an atlas of 17,249 Pol III\u2013transcribed Alu elements. We further performed an integrative analysis on the ChIP-seq data of 10 histone marks and hundreds of transcription factors, whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data, ChIA-PET data, and functional data in several biosamples, and our results revealed that although the human-specific Alu elements are transcriptionally repressed, the older, expressed Alu elements may be exapted by the human host to function as cell-type\u2013specific enhancers for their nearby protein-coding genes.",
