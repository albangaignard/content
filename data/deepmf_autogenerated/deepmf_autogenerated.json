Nevertheless, current matrix factorization tools fall short in handling noisy data and missing entries, both deficiencies that are often found in real-life data. Results: Here, we propose DeepMF, a deep neural network-based factorization model. DeepMF disentangles the association between molecular feature-associated and sample-associated latent matrices, and is tolerant to noisy and missing values. It exhibited feasible cancer subtype discovery efficacy on mRNA, miRNA, and protein profiles of medulloblastoma cancer, leukemia cancer, breast cancer, and small-blue-round-cell cancer, achieving the highest clustering accuracy of 76%, 100%, 92%, and 100% respectively. When analyzing data sets with 70% missing entries, DeepMF gave the best recovery capacity with silhouette values of 0.47, 0.6, 0.28, and 0.44, outperforming other state-of-the-art MF tools on the cancer data sets Medulloblastoma, Leukemia, TCGA BRCA, and SRBCT. Its embedding strength as measured by clustering accuracy is 88%, 100%, 84%, and 96% on these data sets, which improves on the current best methods 76%, 100%, 78%, and 87%. Conclusion: DeepMF demonstrated robust denoising, imputation, and embedding ability. It offers insights to uncover the underlying biological processes such as cancer subtype discovery.
