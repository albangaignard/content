    "description": "a web database providing comprehensive information on Japanese pear transcriptome.\n\nJapanese pear (Pyrus pyrifolia) is a major fruit tree in the family Rosaceae and is bred for fruit production. To promote the development of breeding strategies and molecular research for Japanese pear, we sequenced the transcripts of Japanese pear variety 'Hosui'. To exhaustively collect information of total gene expression, RNA samples from various organs and stages of Japanese pear were sequenced by three technologies, single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing, 454 pyrosequencing, and Sanger sequencing. Using all those reads, we determined comprehensive reference sequences of Japanese pear. Then, their protein sequences were predicted, and biological functional annotations were assigned.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Japanese pear', 'nashi', 'Rosaceae'",

To promote the development of breeding strategies and molecular research for Japanese pear, we sequenced the transcripts of Japanese pear variety \u2018Hosui\u2019. To exhaustively collect information of total gene expression, RNA samples from various organs and stages of Japanese pear were sequenced by three technologies, single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing, 454 pyrosequencing, and Sanger sequencing. Using all those reads, we determined comprehensive reference sequences of Japanese pear. Then, their protein sequences were predicted, and biological functional annotations were assigned. Finally, we developed a web database, TRANSNAP (http://plantomics.mind.meiji.ac.jp/nashi), which is the first web resource of Japanese pear omics information. This database provides highly reliable information via a user-friendly web interface: the reference sequences, gene functional annotations, and gene expression profiles from microarray experiments. In addition, based on sequence comparisons among Japanese, Chinese and European pears, similar protein sequences among the pears and species-specific proteins in Japanese pear can be quickly and efficiently identified. TRANSNAP will aid molecular research and breeding in Japanese pear, and its information is available for comparative analysis among other pear species and families.",
