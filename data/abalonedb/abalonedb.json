                "abstract": "\u00a9 2019 Botwright et al.Wild abalone (Family Haliotidae) populations have been severely affected by commercial fishing, poaching, anthropogenic pollution, environment and climate changes. These issues have stimulated an increase in aquaculture production; however production growth has been slow due to a lack of genetic knowledge and resources. We have sequenced a draft genome for the commercially important temperate Australian \u2018greenlip\u2019 abalone (Haliotis laevigata, Donovan 1808) and generated 11 tissue transcriptomes from a female adult abalone. Phylogenetic analysis of the greenlip abalone with reference to the Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) indicates that these abalone species diverged approximately 71 million years ago. This study presents an in-depth analysis into the features of reproductive dysfunction, where we provide the putative biochemical messenger components (neuropeptides) that may regulate reproduction including gonad maturation and spawning. Indeed, we isolate the egg-laying hormone neuropeptide and under trial conditions induce spawning at 80% efficiency. Altogether, we provide a solid platform for further studies aimed at stimulating advances in abalone aquaculture production. The H. laevigata genome and resources are made available to the public on the abalone \u2018omics website, http://abalonedb.org.",
