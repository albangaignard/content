This article contains the overall and individual loading characteristics applied on screw-type osseointegrated implant generated by transfemoral bone-anchored prostheses fitted with basic components during daily activities at self-selected comfortable pace. Overall and individual data was presented for the (A) spatio-temporal characteristics, (B) loading patterns, (C) loading boundaries and (D) the loading local extremum during level walking, ascending and descending ramp and stairs. Inter-participant variability of these new datasets with basic components is critical to improve the efficacy and safety of prosthetic components as well as the design of future automated algorithms and clinical trials.
