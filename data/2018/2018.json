    "description": "Nucleus segmentation across imaging experiments.\n\nDeep Retina 3th place solution to Kaggle's 2018 Data Science Bowl.\n\nThis solution is based on Matterport's Mask_RCNN implementation on keras/tensorflow. Please look at the original repository (https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN) for specific details. This is an implementation of Mask R-CNN on Python 3, Keras, and TensorFlow. The model generates bounding boxes and segmentation masks for each instance of an object in the image. It's based on Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and a ResNet101 backbone. I have used the pretrained COCO weights as the starting point for my training on the nuclei segmentation dataset.\n\nFind the nuclei in divergent images to advance medical discovery.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Nucleus segmentation across imaging experiments', 'Bowl', 'configuration-free', 'deep-learning-based'",

                "abstract": "\u00a9 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.Segmenting the nuclei of cells in microscopy images is often the first step in the quantitative analysis of imaging data for biological and biomedical applications. Many bioimage analysis tools can segment nuclei in images but need to be selected and configured for every experiment. The 2018 Data Science Bowl attracted 3,891 teams worldwide to make the first attempt to build a segmentation method that could be applied to any two-dimensional light microscopy image of stained nuclei across experiments, with no human interaction. Top participants in the challenge succeeded in this task, developing deep-learning-based models that identified cell nuclei across many image types and experimental conditions without the need to manually adjust segmentation parameters. This represents an important step toward configuration-free bioimage analysis software tools.",
