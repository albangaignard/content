    "description": "> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'NDN', 'ISP', 'congestion', 'auction' | Joint deep learning and auction for congestion-aware caching in Named Data Networking | Over the last few decades, the Internet has experienced tremendous growth in data traffic. This continuous growth due to the increase in the number of connected devices and platforms has dramatically boosted content consumption. However, retrieving content from the servers of Content Providers (CPs) can increase network traffic and incur high network delay and congestion. To address these challenges, we propose a joint deep learning and auction-based approach for congestion-aware caching in Named Data Networking (NDN), which aims to prevent congestion and minimize the content downloading delays. First, using recorded network traffic data on the Internet Service Provider (ISP) network, we propose a deep learning model to predict future traffic over transit links",

This continuous growth due to the increase in the number of connected devices and platforms has dramatically boosted content consumption. However, retrieving content from the servers of Content Providers (CPs) can increase network traffic and incur high network delay and congestion. To address these challenges, we propose a joint deep learning and auction-based approach for congestion-aware caching in Named Data Networking (NDN), which aims to prevent congestion and minimize the content downloading delays. First, using recorded network traffic data on the Internet Service Provider (ISP) network, we propose a deep learning model to predict future traffic over transit links. Second, to prevent congestion and avoid high latency on transit links, which may experience congestion in the future; we propose a caching model that helps the ISP to cache content that has a high predicted future demand. Paid-content requires payment to be downloaded and cached. Therefore, we propose an auction mechanism to obtain paid-content at an optimal price. The simulation results show that our proposal prevents congestion and increases the profits of both ISPs and CPs.",
