                "abstract": "\u00a9 2019 The Protein SocietyHybrid Electron Microscopy Normal Mode Analysis (HEMNMA) method was introduced in 2014. HEMNMA computes normal modes of a reference model (an atomic structure or an electron microscopy map) of a molecular complex and uses this model and its normal modes to analyze single-particle images of the complex to obtain information on its continuous conformational changes, by determining the full distribution of conformational variability from the images. An advantage of HEMNMA is a simultaneous determination of all parameters of each image (particle conformation, orientation, and shift) through their iterative optimization, which allows applications of HEMNMA even when the effects of conformational changes dominate those of orientational changes. HEMNMA was first implemented in Xmipp and was using MATLAB for statistical analysis of obtained conformational distributions and for fitting of underlying trajectories of conformational changes. A HEMNMA implementation independent of MATLAB is now available as part of a plugin of Scipion V2.0 (http://scipion.i2pc.es). This plugin, named ContinuousFlex, can be installed by following the instructions at https://pypi.org/project/scipion-em-continuousflex. In this article, we present this new HEMNMA software, which is user-friendly, totally free, and open-source.
