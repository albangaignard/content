A number of studies have demonstrated that hundreds of non-coding RNAs, including miRNAs and lncRNAs, are involved in metabolic syndrome-related diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, etc. However, these research results are distributed in a large number of literature, which is not conducive to analysis and use. There is an urgent need to integrate these relationship data between metabolic syndrome and non-coding RNA into a specialized database. To address this need, we developed a metabolic syndrome-associated non-coding RNA database (ncRNA2MetS) to curate the associations between metabolic syndrome and non-coding RNA. Currently, ncRNA2MetS contains 1,068 associations between five metabolic syndrome traits and 627 non-coding RNAs (543 miRNAs and 84 lncRNAs) in four species. Each record in ncRNA2MetS database represents a pair of disease-miRNA (lncRNA) association consisting of non-coding RNA category, miRNA (lncRNA) name, name of metabolic syndrome trait, expressive patterns of non-coding RNA, method for validation, specie involved, a brief introduction to the association, the article referenced, etc. We also developed a user-friendly website so that users can easily access and download all data. In short, ncRNA2MetS is a complete and high-quality data resource for exploring the role of non-coding RNA in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome and seeking new treatment options.
