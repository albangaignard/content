                "abstract": "\u00a9 2019 The Author(s).Background: The morbidity and mortality of endometrial tumors, a common type of malignant cancer in women, have increased in recent years. POLE encodes the DNA polymerase \u03f5, which is responsible for the leading strand DNA replication. Somatic mutations of POLE have been acknowledged in numerous cancers, resulting in the accumulation of DNA errors, leading to ultra-mutated tumors. Mutations in the exonuclease domain of POLE have been reported to improve progression-free survival in endometrial cancer. However, the potential relationship and underlying mechanism between POLE mutations and the prognosis of endometrial cancer patients remains unclear. Methods: The whole exome sequencing data, RNA sequencing data, and clinical information were obtained from the TCGA database and employed for the analyses in this study. The detailed mutational information was analyzed using whole exome sequencing data and the mutated genes were shown with OncoPlot. The survival curves and cox proportional hazards regression analysis were used to accessed patient prognosis, the association of clinical characteristics and prognosis. Differentially expressed genes were analyzed by the edgeR R/Bioconductor package, then the GSEA Pre-ranked tool was used for Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to estimate the function of genes. Expression values were clustered using hierarchical clustering with Euclidean distance and ward linkage by the dendextend R package. Results: POLE mutational status was proven to be an independent prognostic factor for endometrial cancer patients. Patients with somatic POLE mutations presented a favorable prognosis. POLE mutations regulated glycolysis and cytokine secretion, affecting cell metabolism and immune response. Autocrine motility factor (AMF)/PGI and AMFR/gp78 exhibited higher expression levels in POLE mutant patients. The comprehensive high expressions of AMFR/gp78 and low expression of POLE were associated with the favorable prognosis of endometrial cancer patients. Conclusions: This study showed the POLE mutations a vital factor in endometrial cancer patients, leading to a higher expression of AMF/PGI and AMFR/gp78. These results suggested comprehensive consideration of the POLE mutations, expression of AMF/PGI and AMFR/gp78 may provide a more feasible and effective approach for the treatment of endometrial cancer, which might improve the prognosis.",
