All rights reserved.Lung cancer has high incidence and mortality rates, and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) is a common form of non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). The aim of our study was to discover long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) associated with LUSC prognosis. RNA-sequencing data obtained from LUSC samples were extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Using the limma package, differentially expressed genes (DEGs; including differentially expressed lncRNA genes (DELs), coding genes (DECs), and other genes (DEOs)) between LUSC and control samples were analyzed. Using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, prognosis-associated lncRNAs were further selected. Following the calculation of Pearson's correlation coefficients between DELs and other DEGs, the DEL-DEG co-expression network was visualized using Cytoscape software. Using the clusterProfiler package, potential functions for DECs co-expressed with DELs were predicted. There were 1,305 DEGs in LUSC samples, including 153 DELs, 1,109 DECs, and 43 DEOs. Based on survival analysis, 22 prognosis-associated lncRNAs (including surfactant associated 1, pseudogene (SFTA1P), long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 968 (LINC00968), GATA6 antisense RNA 1, (GATA6-AS1) TBX5 antisense RNA 1 (TBX5-AS1) and FEZF1 antisense RNA 1 (FEZF1-AS1)) in LUSC were selected from these DELs, and the associated abnormal expression levels were also verified in LUSC clinical samples. A DEL-DEG co-expression network was constructed, which involved 93 DELs. Co-expressed DECs were enriched for only 8 prognosis-associated DELs, including LINC00968, SFTA1P, and TBX5-AS1. Specifically, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway-associated genes were enriched in DECs co-expressed with LINC00968, SFTA1P, GATA6-AS1, TBX5-AS1 and FEZF1-AS1, which may be prognosis-associated lncRNAs in LUSC. In addition, LINC00968 may affect the outcome of patients with LUSC via the MAPK signaling pathway.",
