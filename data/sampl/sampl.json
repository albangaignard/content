Although computer-aided drug design has greatly improved over time, its application in the pharmaceutical industry is still limited by the accuracy of association constant (K a ) predictions. Towards improving this situation, the Statistical Assessment of the Modeling of Proteins and Ligands (SAMPL) is a series of community-wide blind challenges aimed to advance computational techniques as standard predictive tools in rational drug design (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAMPL_Challenge). As an empirical contribution to SAMPL6, we report here the K a and thermodynamic parameters (\u2206G, \u2206H,\u2013T\u2206S) of eight guests binding to two hosts (OA and TEMOA) using ITC. Both hosts contain a unique, well-defined binding pocket capable of storing guests with up to ten non-hydrogen atoms, whilst the selection of amphiphilic guests contain a range of saturated and unsaturated substituents. The thermodynamic data from this study will allow the challenge participants of SAMPL6 to test the accuracy of their computational protocols for calculating host-guest affinities.",
