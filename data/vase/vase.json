    "description": "Facilities that make the PDB data collection more powerful.\n\nVisualization of Alignments Structures and Entropy.\n\nWelcome to the tool for Visualization of Alignments, Structure and Entropy (VASE).\n\nVASE is a web-tool for visualizing alignments on a protein structure. It allows you to enter the ID of a protein structure in PDB format for which VASE will generate an interface. VASE will show a set of homologous sequences, aligned to the sequence of your structure, along with entropy/variability data and a 3D interface. Here's an example: 1CRN.\n\nIf you only want VASE to display the content of a series of VASE-format xml files, then you can set 'xmlonly' to true and set the 'cache' path to the directory where the files are located.\n\nThe configuration file is at src/main/resources/config.properties.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'PDB', 'PDF-formatted', 'remade'",

                "abstract": "\u00a9 2019 The Authors. Protein Science published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of The Protein Society.We describe a series of databases and tools that directly or indirectly support biomedical research on macromolecules, with focus on their applicability in protein structure bioinformatics research. DSSP, that determines secondary structures of proteins, has been updated to work well with extremely large structures in multiple formats. The PDBREPORT database that lists anomalies in protein structures has been remade to remove many small problems. These reports are now available as PDF-formatted files with a computer-readable summary. The VASE software has been added to analyze and visualize HSSP multiple sequence alignments for protein structures. The Lists collection of databases has been extended with a series of databases, most noticeably with a database that gives each protein structure a grade for usefulness in protein structure bioinformatics projects. The PDB-REDO collection of reanalyzed and re-refined protein structures that were solved by X-ray crystallography has been improved by dealing better with sugar residues and with hydrogen bonds, and adding many missing surface loops. All academic software underlying these protein structure bioinformatics applications and databases are now publicly accessible, either directly from the authors or from the GitHub software repository.",
