                "abstract": "\u00a9 2019 The Author(s).Background: Jatropha curcas is an oil-bearing plant, and has seeds with high oil content (~ 40%). Several advantages, such as easy genetic transformation and short generation duration, have led to the emergence of J. curcas as a model for woody energy plants. With the development of high-throughput sequencing, the genome of Jatropha curcas has been sequenced by different groups and a mass of transcriptome data was released. How to integrate and analyze these omics data is crucial for functional genomics research on J. curcas. Results: By establishing pipelines for processing novel gene identification, gene function annotation, and gene network construction, we systematically integrated and analyzed a series of J. curcas transcriptome data. Based on these data, we constructed a J. curcas database (JCDB), which not only includes general gene information, gene functional annotation, gene interaction networks, and gene expression matrices but also provides tools for browsing, searching, and downloading data, as well as online BLAST, the JBrowse genome browser, ID conversion, heatmaps, and gene network analysis tools. Conclusions: JCDB is the most comprehensive and well annotated knowledge base for J. curcas. We believe it will make a valuable contribution to the functional genomics study of J. curcas. The database is accessible at http://jcdb.xtbg.ac.cn.",
