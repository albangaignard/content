                "abstract": "\u00a9 2019 Spandidos Publications. All rights reserved.Ependymomas (EPNs) are one of the most common types of malignant neuroepithelial tumors. In an effort to identify potential biomarkers involved in the pathogenesis of EPN, the mRNA expression profiles of the GSE25604, GSE50161, GSE66354, GSE74195 and GSE86574 datasets, in addition to the microRNA (miRNA/miR) expression profiles of GSE42657 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) between EPN and normal brain tissue samples were identified using the Limma package in R and GEO2R, respectively. Functional and pathway enrichment analyses were conducted using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery. A protein-protein interaction network was constructed using the Search Tool for Retrieval of Interacting Genes database, which was visualized using Cytoscape. The targeted genes of DEMs were predicted using miRWalk2.0 and a miRNA-mRNA regulatory network was constructed. Following analysis, a total of 948 DEGs and 129 DEMs were identified. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that 609 upregulated DEGs were significantly enriched in \u2018PI3K-Akt signaling pathway\u2019, while 339 downregulated DEGs were primarily involved in \u2018cell junction\u2019 and \u2018retrograde endocannabinoid signaling\u2019. In addition, 6 hub genes [cyclin dependent kinase 1, CD44 molecule (Indian blood group) (CD44), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), MYC, synaptotagmin 1 (SYT1) and kinesin family member 4A] and 6 crucial miRNAs [homo sapiens (hsa)-miR-34a-5p, hsa-miR-449a, hsa-miR-106a-5p, hsa-miR-124-3p, hsa-miR-128-3p and hsa-miR-330-3p] were identified as biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for EPN. Furthermore, a microRNA-mRNA regulatory network was constructed to highlight the interactions between DEMs and their target DEGs; this included the hsa-miR-449a-SYT1, hsa-miR-34a-5p-SYT1, hsa-miR-330-3p-CD44 and hsa-miR-124-3p-PCNA pairs, whose expression levels were confirmed using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In conclusion, the present study may provide important data for the investigation of the molecular mechanisms of EPN pathogenesis.",
