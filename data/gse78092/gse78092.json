                "abstract": "\u00a9 2019 The Author(s).Background: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are involved in regulating tumor pathogenesis. The mechanism of circRNAs in gastric cancer (GC) is still unknown. Our study aimed to identify differentially expressed circRNAs and assess a novel circRNA (hsa_circ_0000144) in the proliferation, migration, and invasion in GC. Methods: Gene ontology (GO) enrichment and analyses of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, pathway network, and the ceRNA regulatory network of hsa_circ_0000144 targeting miRNAs and mRNAs were performed with the help of bioinformatics using R language and Perl software. hsa_circ_0000144 expression and circRNA knockdown in GC cell lines were detected using quantitative PCR (qPCR) in vitro. Cell proliferation, migration, and invasion after circRNA knockdown were measured using the cell counting kit-8 assay and Transwell assay. Results: The circRNA expression profile GSE78092 downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database included three GC patients and three normal tissues. Thirty-two differentially expressed circRNAs comprised six upregulated circRNAs and 26 downregulated circRNAs. In particular, the ErbB signaling pathway, neurotrophin signaling pathway, cellular senescence, and pathways in bladder cancer and GC played the most important roles in the pathway network. The expression of hsa_circ_0000144 was upregulated in GC cell lines. Hsa_circ_0000144 knockdown suppressed tumor growth in vitro. Conclusions: Hsa_circ_0000144 promotes GC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and the ceRNA regulatory network of hsa_circ_0000144 targeting miRNAs and mRNAs might be biomarkers for GC diagnosis and targeted therapy.",
