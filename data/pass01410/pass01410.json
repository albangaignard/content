                "abstract": "\u00a9 2019 The AuthorsMyopia is an abnormal refractive status, explained by an excessive ocular lengthening mostly in posterior segments. Although growing evidence of anterior segments, specifically altered corneal geometries with biomechanical properties in myopes have been reported, the mechanism behind is poorly understood. We hereby prepared experimentally induced highly myopic chicks to investigate the molecular basis of corneal remodeling by applying a novel proteomic approach integrated with information dependent acquisition (IDA) and data independent quantification (SWATH-MS) analysis. As a result, differentially expressed protein biomarkers that might be involved in structural changes were screened based on the first of its kind unique chicken corneal proteome. All generated raw data from IDA and SWATH-MS are accessible at Peptide Atlas public repository (http://www.peptideatlas.org/PASS/PASS01410) for general release.",
