The latest meta-analysis of ASD GWAS (genome-wide association studies) has revealed the association of several SNPs that were replicated in additional sets of independent samples. However, summary statistics from GWAS can be used to perform a gene-based analysis (GBA). GBA allows to combine all genetic information across the gene to create a single statistic (p-value for each gene). Thus, PASCAL (Pathway scoring algorithm), a novel GBA tool, has been applied to the summary statistics from the latest meta-analysis of ASD. GBA approach (testing the gene as a unit) provides an advantage to perform an accurate insight into the biological ASD mechanisms. Therefore, a gene-network analysis and an enrichment analysis for KEGG and GO terms were carried out. GENE2FUNC was used to create gene expression heatmaps and to carry out differential expression analysis (DEA) across GTEx v7 tissues and Brainspan data. dbMDEGA was employed to perform a DEG analysis between ASD and brain control samples for the associated genes and interactors. Results: PASCAL has identified the following loci associated with ASD: XRN2, NKX2-4, PLK1S1, KCNN2, NKX2-2, CRHR1-IT1, C8orf74 and LOC644172. While some of these genes were previously reported by MAGMA (XRN2, PLK1S1, and KCNN2), PASCAL has been useful to highlight additional genes. The biological characterization of the ASD-associated genes and their interactors have demonstrated the association of several GO and KEGG terms. Moreover, DEA analysis has revealed several up- and down-regulated clusters. In addition, many of the ASD-associated genes and their interactors have shown association with ASD expression datasets. Conclusions: This study identifies several associations at a gene level in ASD. Most of them were previously reported by MAGMA. This fact proves that PASCAL is an efficient GBA tool to extract additional information from previous GWAS. In addition, this study has characterized for the first time the biological role of the ASD-associated genes across brain regions, neurodevelopmental stages, and ASD gene-expression datasets.",
