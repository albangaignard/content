The software consists of a collection of algorithms that are commonly used to solve (medical) image registration problems. The modular design of elastix allows the user to quickly configure, test, and compare different registration methods for a specific application. A command-line interface enables automated processing of large numbers of data sets, by means of scripting. Nowadays elastix is accompanied by SimpleElastix , making it available in languages like C++, Python, Java, R, Ruby, C# and Lua.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'dosimetric'",

                "abstract": "\u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2019 Qiao, Jagt, Hoogeman, Lelieveldt and Staring.Objective: Our goal was to investigate the performance of an open source deformable image registration package, elastix, for fast and robust contour propagation in the context of online-adaptive intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) for prostate cancer. Methods: A planning and 7\u201310 repeat CT scans were available of 18 prostate cancer patients. Automatic contour propagation of repeat CT scans was performed using elastix and compared with manual delineations in terms of geometric accuracy and runtime. Dosimetric accuracy was quantified by generating IMPT plans using the propagated contours expanded with a 2 mm (prostate) and 3.5 mm margin (seminal vesicles and lymph nodes) and calculating dosimetric coverage based on the manual delineation. A coverage of V95% \u2265 98% (at least 98% of the target volumes receive at least 95% of the prescribed dose) was considered clinically acceptable. Results: Contour propagation runtime varied between 3 and 30 s for different registration settings. For the fastest setting, 83 in 93 (89.2%), 73 in 93 (78.5%), and 91 in 93 (97.9%) registrations yielded clinically acceptable dosimetric coverage of the prostate, seminal vesicles, and lymph nodes, respectively. For the prostate, seminal vesicles, and lymph nodes the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) was 0.87 \u00b1 0.05, 0.63 \u00b1 0.18, and 0.89 \u00b1 0.03 and the mean surface distance (MSD) was 1.4 \u00b1 0.5 mm, 2.0 \u00b1 1.2 mm, and 1.5 \u00b1 0.4 mm, respectively. Conclusion: With a dosimetric success rate of 78.5\u201397.9%, this software may facilitate online adaptive IMPT of prostate cancer using a fast, free and open implementation.",
