However, for expression data generated by different experimental design and platforms, there is currently lack of capability to determine the most proper statistical model. Results: We developed an R package, namely Multi-Modal Model Selection (M3S), for gene-wise selection of the most proper multi-modality statistical model and downstream analysis, useful in a single-cell or large scale bulk tissue transcriptomic data. M3S is featured with (1) gene-wise selection of the most parsimonious model among 11 most commonly utilized ones, that can best fit the expression distribution of the gene, (2) parameter estimation of a selected model, and (3) differential gene expression test based on the selected model. Conclusion: A comprehensive evaluation suggested that M3S can accurately capture the multimodality on simulated and real single cell data.
